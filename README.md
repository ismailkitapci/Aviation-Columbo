Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Accreditation of psychomotor tests used in pilot recruitment

## Background

Psychomotor tests are designed by third parties and submitted to airlines. A final report is submitted.
What regulation determines the airline's psychomotor criteria?
How are initial test results invalidated when pilots are admitted to the same test a second time?
Psychomotor tests are administered online. Can pyloric sensitivity be accurately measured in a flight simulator?


## How is it used?

Those with scientific accreditation of psychomotor tests must be approved by the FAA and EASA and put into use.

## Challenges

Many national flag carrier airlines, including those in other countries, do not conduct these tests based on objective criteria in pilot selection.

## What next?

Psychomotor test accreditation and approval by civil aviation should be notified to candidates before pilot selections.
